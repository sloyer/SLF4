A few notes
=========

The only thing Wordpress has going for it, is that it's really easy to build small scale sites in it and extremely easy to ingergrate with Foundation. 

To set up....

1. Foundation files are already tied into the theme - You can always downlaod the latest version and plug everyhting in. Build your pages the foundation way like you would a normal web-page. 

2. Ready to rock with Sass, you may need to update the gem.

3. Mean Menu is ready to rock, way better than top bar. Its all set up already, just build your nav out normally  -
<nav>
	<ul>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
	</ul>
</nav>

And it will work.
